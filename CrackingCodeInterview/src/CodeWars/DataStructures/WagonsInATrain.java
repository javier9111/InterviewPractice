/***
 * You are in a Train that is permanently moving in a circle. The Train is looped: The head is connected with the tail and you can go from one to another directly.

Every wagon has a light, you can switch it on and off if you wish.

Count the number of wagons!

You can move between wagons as you wish.

Constraints:
After you count the wagons, the lights in the train should be in the initial state they were in. But at the end you don't need to be in the same wagon where you started.

Use the implemented Train methods:

public boolean isLightOnInCurrentWagon()

public void switchLight()

public void goToNextWagon()

public void goToPreviousWagon()
Train notation "1 : 0 : 0" means that you have a train with three wagons. The light is on in the first wagon and off in the other two.
